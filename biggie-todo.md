# Todo

Todo lists for each crate in this workspace, which will ultimately be a game ***someday***

## Watery Wails

- Start getting basic game logic in place
- inject goal to frog to stare at camera when player is looking at them. Then after a while of staring if the player is still looking he shoots his tongue and disables the camera for a short while

## Bevy HTNP

- (Maybe someday) Create some variant processing systems and lock compilation behind a feature flag to provide alternate processing styles

## ~~Bevy HTNP Luau~~

> Scrapped due to technical debt. Maybe I'll give it a shot again sometime. For now, focusing on robust features in HTNP and the actual game
